my version of BNF stored in JSON:

the whole json is a list of BNF-like statements

each statement has:
name (the name of the variable it is defining)
and can optionally have:
choice (can have any one of these)
required (must have all of these in order)

each of the items in choice or required must have:
name (the variable it is referencing)
can repeat (whether you can have multiple of these)
optional (whether you can have none of these)
